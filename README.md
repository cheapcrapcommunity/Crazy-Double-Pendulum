# Crazy-Double-Pendulum
I want to create a Double Pendulum that not only relies on its physical characteristics but is also controlled by multiple settings, and these settings will cause some unexpected movement triggering certain behaviors when they meet some conditions and they cross over, sometimes like a seesaw, or sometimes like an object under an enchantment â€“ which will change its own physical parameters instantly such as the mass and dumping value, without any external force. I applied 1st/2nd/3rd Markov chain and probabilities rules in this patch.
